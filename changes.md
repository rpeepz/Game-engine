Heres a game engine I wrote in C. It can be used to display rectangular shapes in 3d.  
The view is with a single players camera in first person. Based off my [wolf3d](https://github.com/rpeepz/Wolf-3D) project
Im looking to further this to work in 2d and add more players...  

I thought about creating a top down view with ray casting, however the idea was flawed, so I shifted towards a fighting style game. Stage and character select are now avaible to test with a menu system.  
No actual fighting mechanics are implemented yet.
